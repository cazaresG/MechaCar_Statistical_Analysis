## T-Tests on Suspension Coils


*t-test 1* ![This is an image](https://github.com/cazaresG/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/03af95e99af36287bba6bec91b1aff04561b2ac8/images/ttest1.png)

In t-test1, we have a test value of 8.71 and a p-value = 1.568e-11 (tending to zero). We reject the null hypothesis and support the alternate hypothesis


*t-test 2*

In t-test-2, we have a test value of 3.67 and a p-value = 0.0005911 (tending to zero). We reject the null hypothesis and support the alternate hypothesis.


*t-test3* 
![This is an image](https://github.com/cazaresG/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/f96fa93d156afef3fae567b9fb7877a8b08e9633/images/ttest3.png)

In t-test-3, we have a test value of -1.4305 (tending to zero) and a p-value = 0.1589 (higher than test value). We cannot reject the null hypothesis, means are likely to be the same.
